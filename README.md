# To-Do-App
to do app with React

This is my first React app deployed by GitHub pages.

I used many hooks to enable users to change the page dramatically.
I'm gonna add new functions, such as connecting this app with database to keep inputs from users.

I put some hidden elements in this app. These are not important for React app, but just for fun.
Please find these and let me know if you can find one of them!
